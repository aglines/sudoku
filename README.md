# Sudoku

A modern terminal-based Sudoku game built with Python, featuring an interactive UI, multiple difficulty levels, and comprehensive puzzle generation.

## Features

üéØ **Interactive Terminal UI** - Rich console interface with colored grid display and cursor navigation
üé≤ **Three Difficulty Levels** - Easy (30 blanks), Medium (40 blanks), Hard (50 blanks)
‚ö° **Fast Puzzle Generation** - Backtracking algorithm creates valid puzzles instantly
üß© **Complete Game Logic** - Full sudoku validation with proper game state management
üéÆ **Intuitive Controls** - Arrow keys or WASD navigation, number input, solution toggle
üèóÔ∏è **Clean Architecture** - Separation of game logic from UI, fully type-hinted codebase
‚úÖ **Comprehensive Testing** - 51 unit tests covering all core functionality

## Quick Start

Install and run:
```bash
pip install -e .
sudoku
```

## Controls

- **Arrow Keys** or **WASD** - Move cursor
- **1-9** - Enter numbers
- **Space** or **0** - Clear cell
