# SUDOKU - code to create and solve sudoku puzzles

## Methodology
- vibe coding practice: write prompts in an IDE with no autocomplete (vscode, having unsubscribed from copilot)
- break prompts down to smaller chunks to ensure code isn't messy spaghetti  
- run prompts in Windsurf or Claude

### Methodology notes
- write the most often re-used prompt strings, bc it's best practice to not assume that a coding LLM will always or consistently follow the system prompts we attempt to give it
